# [Project 1: Covid-19 Analysis]

Performed covid-19 analysis on Italy dataset. The dataset was taken from Kaggle. I performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Time Series Analysis on the given dataset. After doing EDA, I also performed ANOVA test. I used ARIMA model for the time series analysis.

# [Project 2: Customer Segmentation Engine]

As a part of this project, I created a customer base segregator wherein performed Exploratory Data Analysis on e-commerce data and then performed clustering analysis.
